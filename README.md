# CRT-QA: A Dataset of Complex Reasoning Question Answering over Tabular Data (EMNLP2023) üìä

This repository contains the CRT-QA dataset, which includes question-answer pairs that require complex reasoning over tabular data. The dataset is currently undergoing some processes at Microsoft Research Asia, and its release is planned once the process is complete. üöÄ

## About the Dataset and Paper

- **Title:** CRT-QA: A Dataset of Complex Reasoning Question Answering over Tabular Data
- **Conference:** EMNLP 2023
- **Authors:** [Zhehao Zhang](https://zzh-sjtu.github.io/zhehaozhang.github.io/), Xitao Li, Yan Gao, Jian-Guang Lou üë©‚Äçüíºüë®‚Äçüíº
- **Affiliation:** Dartmouth College, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Microsoft Research Asia üè¢

The dataset contains question-answer pairs along with metadata for each question. It includes `dataset.json` for the main experiments and `unanswerable.json` for Unanswerable and Indeterminate Questions.

### Data Format

The data is stored in a json file, structured with the following fields for each datapoint (keyed by a .csv file table):

```
Question name, Title, step1, step2, step3, step4, Answer, Directness, Composition Type
```

- `Question name`: The text of the question
- `Title`: The title of the table that the question refers to
- `step1` to `step4`: Steps describing the reasoning process and operations used to answer the question
  - `type`: `Operation` or `Reasoning`
  - `name`: Name of the specific operation or reasoning type
  - `detail`: Additional details about the step
- `Answer`: The answer text
- `Directness`: `Explicit` or `Implicit` question
- `Composition Type`: `Bridging`, `Intersection`, or `Comparison`

### Reasoning and Operations

The reasoning and operations referenced in the `step` fields come from a defined taxonomy:

**Operations:**
- Indexing
- Filtering
- Grouping
- Sorting

**Reasoning:**
- Grounding
- Auto-categorization
- Temporal Reasoning
- Geographical/Spatial Reasoning
- Aggregating
- Arithmetic
- Reasoning with Quantifiers
- Other Commonsense Reasoning

### Status üöß

The code and data for this project are currently being prepared and reviewed. We aim to release them as soon as the process is completed. Stay tuned for updates!

    abstract = "Large language models (LLMs) show powerful reasoning abilities on various text-based tasks. However, their reasoning capability on structured data such as tables has not been systematically explored. In this work, we first establish a comprehensive taxonomy of reasoning and operation types for tabular data analysis. Then, we construct a complex reasoning QA dataset over tabular data, named CRT-QA dataset (Complex Reasoning QA over Tabular data), with the following unique features: (1) it is the first Table QA dataset with multi-step operation and informal reasoning; (2) it contains fine-grained annotations on questions{'} directness, composition types of sub-questions, and human reasoning paths which can be used to conduct a thorough investigation on LLMs{'} reasoning ability; (3) it contains a collection of unanswerable and indeterminate questions that commonly arise in real-world situations. We further introduce an efficient and effective tool-augmented method, named ARC (Auto-exemplar-guided Reasoning with Code), to use external tools such as Pandas to solve table reasoning tasks without handcrafted demonstrations. The experiment results show that CRT-QA presents a strong challenge for baseline methods and ARC achieves the best result.",
